Welcome to the world of C++ programming! This is a very simple example which will print the classic
greeting message, `"Hello World!!!"` to the console.

It's a fundamental first step for anyone learning a new programming language, as it demonstrates the
basic structure of a C++ program and also tests your development environment.

### Code

{: file="hello_world.cpp" }

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::cout << "Hello World!!!" << std::endl;
}
```

### Output

{: .nolineno }

```bash
Hello World!!!
```
